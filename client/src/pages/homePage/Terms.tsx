            <p>
              Wager Games operates fantasy contests in which users can create
              “teams” to compete against one another (“Fantasy Contests”). Wager
              Games’s Fantasy Contests, and those portions of the Services used
              to register for or compete in Fantasy Contests, are open only to
              eligible users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Except as explicitly stated in connection with a particular
              Fantasy Contest, Wager Games is the exclusive sponsor of all
              Fantasy Contests Offered through the Services.

                <strong>Eligibility for Fantasy Contests </strong>
              </li>
              <p>
                Some states require operators of Fantasy Contests to be licensed
                or registered in order to offer contests to residents of that
                state. If you are physically located in a state with such a
                license or registration requirement at the time that you are
                entering a Fantasy Contest, and Wager Games does not have a
                license to operate in that state, you may not be able to
                participate in Fantasy Contests.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you plan to access or participate in Fantasy Contests, you
                hereby represent and warrant that you are fully able and
                competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations,
                affirmations, representations and warranties set forth in these
                terms and to abide by and comply with these terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                By entering a Fantasy Contest, you are further representing and
                warranting that:

                </li>
                <li>
                  you are a citizen or resident of the United States of America

                </li>
                <li>
                  you will abide at all times by these Terms of Use and any

                <li>
                  you are not subject to backup withholding tax because: (a) you
                  are exempt from backup withholding, or (b) you have not been
                  notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that you are

                <li>
                  when entering a Fantasy Contest, you are not an employee or
                  operator of another daily fantasy site that charges entrance
                  fees or offers cash prizes;
                </li>
                <li>
                  you do not, by virtue of affiliation with another daily
                  fantasy site, have access to the site’s pre-release non-public
                  confidential data about Fantasy Contest-related information.
                </li>
              </ul>

                If Wager Games determines that you do not meet the eligibility
                requirements of this section, then you are not authorized to
                access or participate in Fantasy Contests. Wager Games may
                require you to provide proof that you are eligible to
                participate according to this section prior to receiving prizes
                from a Fantasy Contests (“Fantasy Prize Winnings”). This
                includes by requesting that you fill out an affidavit of
                eligibility or other verification information (as discussed in
                Section 3.v.f. below). If Wager Games otherwise determines that
                you do not meet the eligibility requirements of this section, in
                addition to any rights that Wager Games may have in law or
                equity, Wager Games reserves the right to terminate your
                account, restrict your account from accessing or participating
                in Fantasy Contests, withhold or revoke the awarding of any
                Fantasy Prize Winnings associated with your account or limit
                your ability to withdraw. In such a situation, Wager Games may
                pay out any withheld or revoked Fantasy Prize Winnings to the
                other entrants in the relevant Fantasy Contest in a manner
                consistent with the prize structure of the Fantasy Contest, to
                be precisely determined by Wager Games in its sole discretion.
                Wager Games also reserves the right to withhold revoked Fantasy
                Prize Winnings to use in furtherance of its fraud prevention or
                anti-money laundering efforts.

                Wager Games employees may use the Services for the purpose of
                testing the user experience, but may not withdraw money or
                Fantasy Prize Winnings. Relatives of Wager Games employees with
                whom they share a household are not eligible to participate in
                Fantasy Contests. Wager Games consultants or promoters of the
                Services may play in Fantasy Contests without such limitation,
                but only if (i) their arrangement with Wager Games does not
                permit them to have any access to non-public Services data or
                any other data not made available to all eligible players on the
                Services and (ii) they do not receive any other advantages in
                their play on the Services.

                Employees or operators of other daily fantasy sites that charge
                entry fees or offer cash prizes and individuals who, by virtue
                of affiliation with another daily fantasy site, have access to
                the site’s pre-release non-public confidential data about
                game-related information may not enter any Fantasy Contests. If
                such person enters an Wager Games Fantasy Contest with a Prize,
                Wager Games will disqualify the entry, will not award the person
                Fantasy Prize Winnings, and may report such person’s violation
                of this provision to the daily fantasy site for which the
                entrant is employed by, operates or affiliated with.
                Additionally, Wager Games may maintain information about the
                entrant sufficient to assist Wager Games in blocking the user
                from entering future Wager Games Fantasy Contests, unless and
                until Wager Games determines, in its sole discretion, that the
                entrant is no longer an employee or operator of another daily
                fantasy site or no longer has access to pre-release non-public
                confidential data about game-related information by virtue of
                affiliation with a daily fantasy site.

                Wager Games offers tools to encourage responsible player
                behavior. We also allow qualified third parties, who have
                concerns about a players ability to manage his or her play, to
                request a limitation on that players participation in Wager
                Games Fantasy Contests. Self-exclusion allows a person to
                request to be excluded from fantasy contests.&nbsp;Individuals
                who enroll in self-exclusion are prohibited from collecting any
                winnings, recovering any losses or accepting complimentary gifts
                or services or any other thing of value from a licensee or
                operator. Any unsettled Contests will be settled on the result
                of each Contest. You can contact Wager Games support at
                support@Wager Gamesfantasy.com to arrange for the payment of
                your winnings in all states excluding Pennsylvania, where all
                winnings awarded during the self-exclusion period are forfeited.

                Wager Games also reserves the right to cancel Fantasy Contests,

                  Wager Games offers a number of different types of Fantasy
                  Contests. For each Fantasy Contest, we announce any applicable
                  entry fees and/or prizes in advance on the Lobby tab of the
                  mobile app and on the Fantasy Contest page. For a summary of

                  Prize calculations are based on the results as of the time
                  when final scoring is tabulated by Wager Games. Once winners
                  are initially announced by Wager Games, the scoring results
                  will not be changed in light of official adjustments made by
                  the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, or PGA, though we reserve the right to
                  make adjustments based on errors or irregularities in the
                  transmission of information to us from our stats provider or
                  in our calculation of results. We also may make adjustments in
                  the event of noncompliance with the Terms. Wager Games has no
                  obligation to delay the awarding of a prize in anticipation of
                  any adjustment, and we reserve the right to reverse payments
                  in the event of any adjustment. You agree to cooperate with
                  our efforts to reverse payments.

                In order to participate in the Services, including Fantasy

                user of the Services, you agree to provide accurate, current and
                complete information about yourself as prompted (such
                information being the “Registration Data”) and maintain and
                promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate,
                current and complete. If you provide any information that is
                inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Wager Games has
                reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is
                inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Wager Games may deny you
                access to areas requiring registration, or terminate your
                account, at its sole discretion.
              </p>

                You may establish, maintain, use and control only one account on

                of doubt, users may not “co-own” accounts on the Services. In

                maintained, used or controlled more than one account, in
                addition to any other rights that Wager Games may have, Wager

                illegal or improper purpose. In such circumstances, we may also

                that you use or have ever used outside of the Service; (b) keep
                your Username and Password confidential and not share them with

                pay in accordance with state-imposed deposit limits.

                If your account remains inactive for the amount of time
                specified by applicable state law, usually between thirty-six
                (36) and sixty (60) months, it will be considered abandoned.
                Once an account is abandoned, Wager Games is required by state
                law to remit the abandoned funds to the appropriate state agency
                as unclaimed property. Wager Games may also charge additional
                fees associated with the delivery of abandoned funds to the
                applicable state agency.

                Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these
                Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the
                parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the

                The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or
                agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes
                arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability,

                The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would

                for the arbitration exceeds $250, Wager Games will pay the
                additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be
                non-frivolous, Wager Games will pay all of the actual filing and
                arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does
                not exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to
                recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties understand
                that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right
                to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand
                that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed
                the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more

                action or other representative action, and the parties expressly
                waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a
                class basis. YOU AND Wager Games AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
                CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
                CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or
                arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in
                this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that
                an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the
                arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and
                void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not
                agreed to arbitrate disputes.

                through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state
                or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights
                (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral
                rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or
                publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small
                claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that
                court’s jurisdiction.
              </p>

                You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the

                of May 21, 2020 or your first use of the Services, whichever is
                later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in
                accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of
                these arbitration provisions, Wager Games also will not be bound
                by them.

            <p>
              You acknowledge and agree that (i) these Terms are binding between
              you and Wager Games only, and Apple is not a party hereto, and
              (ii) as between Wager Games and Apple, it is Wager Games that is
              responsible for the mobile app and the content thereof. You must
              use the iOS app only on an Apple-branded product that runs iOS.
              Your use of the app must comply with the terms of use applicable
              to the Apple source from which you obtain it (including the Usage
              Rules set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service). You
              acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to furnish you with any
              maintenance and support services with respect to the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any
              claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the
              app or your possession and use of the app, including, but not
              limited to (i) product warranty or liability claims; (ii) any
              claim that the app fails to conform to any applicable legal or
              regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer
              protection or similar legislation; or (iv) claims that the app

            </p>
            <p>
              In the event of any failure of the iOS version of the app to
              conform to any applicable warranty that has not been effectively
              disclaimed by these Terms, you may notify Apple, and Apple will
              refund the purchase price for the app (if any) to you; to the
              maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no
              other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the app, and,
              as between Apple and Wager Games, any other claims, losses,
              liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any
              failure to conform to any warranty will be Wager Games’
              responsibility, but only to the extent provided by these Terms.
              Please read the entire Terms, as other sections of these Terms
              limit Wager Games’ liability in this regard.

              Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of
              these Terms. Upon your acceptance of the Terms, Apple will have
              the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to
              enforce the Terms against you as a third party beneficiary
              thereof. There are no other third-party beneficiaries of the
              Terms.

              <strong>Age Restrictions</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
              Fantasy Contests are generally restricted to users over the age of
              18, but some states impose a higher minimum age. If you are under
              18 or the minimum age in your state of residence, you may not
              access the Services.

              <p>
                These Terms (and any additional terms, rules and conditions of
                participation in particular Fantasy Contests that Wager Games
                may post on the Services) constitute the entire agreement
                between you and Wager Games with respect to the Services and
                supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written, between you
                and Wager Games. In the event of a conflict between these Terms
                and the additional terms, rules and conditions of participation
                in particular Fantasy Contests, the latter will prevail over the
                Terms to the extent of the conflict.

                <strong>Waiver and Severability of Terms</strong>
              </li>
              <p>
                The failure of Wager Games to exercise or enforce any right or
                provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
                right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by an
                arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the
                parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should
                endeavor to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected
                in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain
                in full force and effect.

                any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the
                use of the Services or the Terms must be filed within one (1)
                year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
                barred. This statute of limitations provision does not apply to
